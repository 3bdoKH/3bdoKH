# About Me: 
sup! I'm Abdulrahman.</br> I code sometimes. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it catches fire.</br> I have a GitHub, somehow.</br>

- writes code that mostly breaks
- makes useless programs nobody asked for
- survives on caffeine, regret, and the occasional panic attack
- pro at copy-pasting StackOverflow (it's called research, fuck off)
- considers "works on my machine" a valid solution
- 90% of my commits are "fixed typo" or "why TF did I do this"
- I love farming
- can't center a div but somehow deployed a website
- believes semicolons are optional

## languages i kinda know
- js? maybe
- python… sometimes
- html lol (is it even a language?)
- C++ (bold as fuck of me to claim this)

## hobbies outside coding (barely)
- farming (virtually, I'm not touching real dirt)
- staring at error messages until they feel bad
- googling "how to exit vim"
- collecting tabs like Pokémon cards
- pretending I understand what the hell async/await does
- questioning my life choices at 3 AM

## find me
- somewhere on the internet
- probably crying over git merge conflicts
- in the fetal position after a failed deployment
- asking ChatGPT why my code doesn't work (again)
- in a farm contemplating a career change to farming (the real kind)

## my code philosophy
```javascript
// if it works, don't touch it
// if it doesn't work, copy-paste until it does
// if all else fails, blame the browser
```
